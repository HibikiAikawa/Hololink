prodigious musical power terrifyingly beautiful in appearance and voice her song raptured All Who heard it unable to resist its Allure however lost in her love of music she hadn't realized the effect her voice had on others all she could think about was singing it was her very nature to do so and all singers want an audience all it took was one fateful performance having seen the men and the woman of the world around her she ascended into the sky to share her gift and sing with all the depths of her power all those who heard unable to withstand the power of her voice were driven to Insanity although she only wanted to share her gift this quickly caught the attention of the Gods in a fits of Rage they broke her horn destroying her powers and sealed her away until the end of time you know it's kind of crazy how your life can change so suddenly Seems Like Only Yesterday I was bound and sealed away for all eternity isolated for years with no friends or sense of belonging it's really hard

myself proper my name is narissa ravencroft if you'd like you can call me Risa like Lisa but with an r or Nary or really anything you'd like I've Loved all the nicknames my senpais have been coming up with so please feel free to do what you would like my birthday is November 21st making me a Scorpio and my job title as you know is the demon of sound or as Twitter has declared the demon of soup but it's the demon of sound trust me I am 175 centimeters tall making me I believe five nine for the Americans out there blood type is a b and uh my age let's just say I'm old enough to drink alcohol okay as for languages I speak English and I speak a little bit of Japanese um I'm not confident enough to say any any right here right now but I can read about two thousand kanji but my grammar and sentence structuring is horrible so I can read them and I know what they mean but it's hard for me to manage meanings but if you're a Japanese speaker please feel free to type in in Japanese in chat and I will do my best to read it and respond it'll be good practice for me I would like to read for you my bio with a deep love of song nerissa ravencroft is the demon of sound her Powerful Love turned into a dark power that inhabited her singing giving her music the potential to drive the entire world mat the gods fearful of her beautiful voice decided to seal her away for eternity but this did not seal away her desire to sing for others while she was sealed away she came across a Japanese otaku culture and is currently fascinated by Idol songs and Pen lights maybe her life in prison wasn't all that bad I like Idols uh I want to go straight into showing you guys my model so I actually have uh these cute notes over here from my gen mates so I'll read this one first uh top left from shiorin it says I wonder what her pet tastes like and the pet she is talking about is my beloved companion Shadow give it up for my boy he's he's a raven not a crow not a grackle he may be small but that's okay um then from mokuko I have imperfect horns to softly caress as you saw in my lore video my horns are not grown like this one is broken I think I think the other part of it still exists somewhere but I I don't know where so I don't think I don't think I can fix it but you know you know down below we have a note from Bijou that says sugoi dekai which I can only assume of course she means my my height obviously because what else would she be talking about then we have a note from our beloved fluava that says fluffy Wings one for each of us to hide under as you can see I do have wings they are functional they are a part of my outfit but they are functional as you also saw in the lore video and I wanted to point out one more thing before before we get too far um I have two weapons you might notice this one's a mic uh I can also change it and oops uh I also had the tuning fork so I have two weapons but for now we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna get rid of both of those because we're gonna move on to the next part so I went to the wrong slide so I would like to talk first about my favorite types of music first I want to go over this cute picture with me and fuamoko we're partying they're super super amazing when it comes to otage and I'm not but they're teaching me so slowly but surely I'm learning uh they're so fun they're so much fun you guys are gonna love them favorite types of music I'm probably gonna go over just a few of everything and not linger too long but but we'll see okay I I don't have a lot of time for something special at the end that you guys will see soon I really love 80s music honestly it's my favorite I'm an old soul at heart so old old music gets to me and the 80s just has that sound you guys know what I mean and um Touhou music you know from like the 2000s 2010s fantastic literally made made my life while I was in the cell sad times music don't worry about that one Idol music I could go on about this for a long time I am a huge huge huge Idol Master fan as well as a love live fan talking and uh uh vehicle are my oshie's in Idol Master Shiki Ichi no say is my Kami Oshi she's the best um I just I love Idol master I love Idol Master music so much but uh really any any Idol music is just very very good eurobeat is also good who doesn't love a little bit of uh fast driving music K-pop I love Annie's Song I love choir music and classical music now um I love to sing this because when I was in the cell for for a long long time I actually didn't want to sing at all because of what happened but I I found classical music while I was there and I was like you know this this is kind of busting so I started singing it a lot so I'm pretty I I'm not a pro or anything at it um but I really like it so video music is also fantastic Ghibli music and weird music TBH don't worry about that one just pretend you do not perceive it favorite foods we have a picture with me and shiorin eating pizza together and my favorite type of pizza actually the first kind on the list pepperoni and pineapple pizza literally hands down my favorite I will not eat anything else I will but this one's the best and if you don't like pineapple on pizza that's okay that's your decision it's okay to be wrong just so you guys know I also love ice cream honestly anything sweet I have a horrid Sweet Tooth chocolate is also one of my vices and last but but my actual favorite favorite food of all time is Korean barbecue we'll actually get into this in the next one but um I want I wanted to say this I I love to cook and I think one of the things that is most enjoyable about cooking is when you're cooking for the people that you love and care about most so Korean barbecue a lot of the times you go in and you sit around a grill right and you're with your friends and you get to cook it yourself and I I'm I'm kind of a I'm kind of a a hog of the tongs and the the scissors so I tend to be the one who's cooking the whole time for everyone and serving everyone because it just brings me so much joy to be able to cook for my friends and I also like I like a lot in kimchi my favorite so moving down we have uh my hobbies we already went over cooking but I also also love to clean it's just so nice to have a properly organized space that's cleanly so you can really really focus on the important things you know what I mean I love to watch musicals I could probably go on about musicals for a long time but for the sake of today I probably shouldn't but I will tell you about my favorite musical in the world uh Elizabeth Das musical it's an Austrian Musical and it's also adapted into Japanese it's so good it's it's in in German obviously or Japanese or a few other languages it's not available in English though sad times but super super good so amazing such a good show highly recommend if it's ever showing near you go see it but the chances of that are probably small but it's it's like my obsession I love to collect jewelry as you guys know I am a raven I'm a demon but I'm also a raven don't don't get too confused by it don't think too hard and um so therefore as a bird I love love love to collect shiny things which is one of the reasons I love Bijou obviously but jewelry is also a shiny thing so having lots of earrings lots of necklaces lots and lots of rings makes me very happy uh this next one embarrassing uh a not playing bass so I I have a bass guitar I love it I don't have calluses on my hands so it just kind of sits in my room looking really really cool and making me look really really cool but I don't I don't know how to play it so I also love to do skincare it's just really fun being able to do being able to do it you know and it makes me feel good it makes me feel good about myself which honestly is is part of the important thing self self-care is important going over to my likes uh two of these kind of connect which is traveling and eating I'm actually a superfood tourist whenever I go anywhere my top thing that I like to do is is eat I love to go new places I love to try new foods literally literally the best thing ever so everywhere I go out I'll find the best restaurants and just eat as much as possible so that's that's one thing that I love I love love love I love mushrooms when it comes to foraging I just love the aesthetic the idea of putting on a little dress getting one of those like little baskets and like a little a little pocket knife and going into the woods and just cutting cutting cutting little mushrooms and putting them in the little basket and bringing them home and like sorting them and like double checking to make sure they're not poisonous and like cooking them like I love the idea of that so much and I can't do it I don't go outside enough um but I love I love the aesthetic of it um I also really love horror horror games horror movies I can handle them pretty well but sometimes I do get caught off guard especially especially if there's a jump scare or something like that but I do my best so um we'll probably enjoy lots of horror things together I also love rainy days who doesn't like a good rainy day helps you sleep because of the sound the pitter patter of the rain moving down to my dislikes um I don't like underwear I'm gonna be frank and I'm going to say this right off the bat so there are no surprises I don't I don't wear them I don't enjoy them they're not they're not for me and I don't think they should be for you either but who am I to tell you what to do but either way I'm strictly no pun thank you um mushrooms in terms of eating you might think that this is weird because I just had mushrooms above but I only enjoy eating enoki mushrooms otherwise they're just not for me not for me um I really don't like polyester I just don't like how it feels on my skin I don't like that it doesn't absorb sweat well so I don't wear it I'd prefer cotton or other natural Fabrics I don't like ice water ice water is not for me I'd prefer my water to be lukewarm or warm or hot so please no no cold water for narissa I also dislike driving I can drive but when you can fly why on Earth would you drive anywhere it just doesn't make any any sense at all so I'd prefer not to but you know sometimes there's only so many people I can carry on my back you know um like Kobo but uh other than that like I can't I can't so I have to drive if I'm taking uh you know the rest of Advent anywhere moving on to my favorite games I really love Nintendo I one of the first games I ever had the opportunity to play was actually Ocarina of Time I remember in the cell I was watching someone someone play it and I I was just like watching through through my little my little cell bars and eventually I think they they saw me and they let me try too and I was addicted it was my first time playing a video game I was just absolutely awestruck um also really a huge fan of story of Seasons uh also known as harvest moon in the past specifically my favorites are 64 Animal Parade and uh it was another wonderful life but they just re-released it recently as just a Wonderful Life those those ones were the best I love when there's rival marriages I love when the rivals have kids that have personalities and and don't stay as babies forever actually the best thing ever um more of a recent Obsession I really really love ff7 I actually didn't I've known about it for a long time but I only discovered it like played it and started getting into it like maybe a few years ago and I just I'm obsessed aerith is my favorite and I it's just so good the world building's so good the story is so good I I'm obsessed uh lesser known game Haunting Ground I I beg and pray every single day for for a remaster not a remake I don't want anything to change I want it to stay exactly as it is um also on this list is higarashi and umaneco I I you know I I love these games I also have it in anime so I'll focus in on Hiroshi this game changed how I saw a lot of a lot of things like friendship everything it changed it changed my world view okay the game and and the anime or the the sound novel it's it's so fantastic it's just so well done I I love it I love it so much uh Naruto 2 I was definitely one of those people who would Naruto run around embarrassing but just don't think too hard about it uh Sailor Moon I I watched it before I realized it was anime I was just like oh cool cartoon and then I was like oh wait wait a minute I don't think this is a cartoon actually um Peach Girl if you know what that is no you don't just just pretend just pretend for the sake of I I have to I feel like I have to explain myself I love the drama of Peach Girl so much it is so it's such a fun show to watch when you're just like looking for something that's like so overly dramatic and I I love like that I can't lie Macross I love giant robots I also love Gundam which isn't listed here uh you see timeline um across is so good though I love Idols I love giant robots so they just they go together so perfectly Clan Ed I like to cry sometimes and this one gets the tears rolling every single time love life and Idol Master but I've already gone off enough about those and more recently Jiu Jitsu Kaizen but I haven't been watching it because I'm actually I don't really read manga too much and I'm I'm waiting for the rest of the anime to come out even if it'll be a long wait because I like to binge watch shows to be honest so I I can't stand I can't stand long long long Waits so I usually tend to wait until shows are completely done till I start them moving on my favorite movie one of my favorite movies of all time I'll start with the first one by satoshikon Perfect blue it is so amazing if you haven't seen it I don't wanna I don't want to give away anything about it but oh my God the first time I saw this movie it blew my mind I think I watched it like five times in a row after that and every single time it was like a new experience you always find something new to it's incredible Spirited Away is also fantastic my very first Ghibli movie it it was just so magical it changed it changed my life forever um and then The Princess Bride who doesn't like a fun-loving very cute very fun movie uh favorite artists I could also go on about these ones for a really obnoxiously long time I love the Smiths um that uh they're not for everyone but they are definitely for me and they're they're good they're really good I've listened to their whole discography I just I'm really I really love them so much um iosis or iOS Ys I call them iosis um I you know Touhou music need I say more I literally it's it changed changed my life uh when I first heard them and then it blew my mind when I found out that they write music now for like Idol master and Idol stuff and Marine Marine Senpai and I'm like oh oh my God like everything's everything's coming together you know so I got I'm such a big fan of them I I love them so much um Jack stauber I think his stuff is so amazing so freaking incredible I I love it to death um it's so good uh it's crazy but it's like that it's like that kind of hard to understand music that's also really really obnoxiously fun you know um I just love it I I love it it's it's so good TM Revolution who doesn't love a little hot limit let's be real uh heart of Sword though I gotta admit that's my favorite TM Revolution song it's just chef's kiss it's so good um he's he's an icon honestly I I'm obsessed I'm obsessed I I watched him I I didn't get to go to a live performance but I got to see a little bit of one and like oh my God amazing performer just amazing amazing vocalist so it's so good love TM Revolution Florence and the Machine they are a little more Moody I suppose but Florence is such a treat to watch she's just and her music is so it's so fantastic I love I love listening I love listening to the sound of her voice um last on this list I actually have a story to go along with so um bear with me okay bear with me um Evanescence specifically the Fallen album okay I need you guys to understand when I was a younger demon in in the cell okay and this this album came out um you know petal he is he is umokus Guy okay he he like the little the little mascot he would he would go I would make him they're basically in the cell there's a basement okay and down in the basement there's this karaoke machine and we didn't have cd players but I had this CD so I would make pedal Carrie and carry back down uh in the morning the the karaoke machine literally every single night and then I would listen to completely Non-Stop the the Fallen as I would fall asleep it was just the best thing ever to me I I don't know why I don't know why I thought that that was good music to fall asleep to because you know nowadays I'm like maybe that's a little depressing but I literally was on the kick of doing that for probably three to four months where I listened to just that that whole album straight every single night so good there's there's tons more I want to talk about so many more like MCR Fallout Boy you know stuff like that but I I think maybe maybe we should move on we have more stuff to get through today otherwise if we're talking about artists I'd literally literally be here all day literally moving on to my hashtags first we have Risa live which is the one if you're tweeting about this debut that you should be using right now then for memes we have mimrisa wanted to keep it pretty pretty simple I know narissa maybe to some people is a bit of a mouthful so I thought shortening it might be a little more fun um music again wanted to keep it simple so uh Risa music please use that if if I've made a cover if I've released an original anything like that if I'm doing uh karaoke please use that tag as well my Oshi Mark is the the sheet music I don't know what it's actually called uh but it's it's cute it's simple it gets a point across I love music I'm a musician um as for my fan art tag you guys have been using this one so much and filling it with the most amazing fan art thank you guys so much for all the love it's Raven crafts because I am a raven and you guys are crafting things so you know it's Raven crafts I you know do does it make sense maybe not but I I thought it did then um fan name some of you might have already figured this out I know I tweeted it out and I also put it in the first video on my channel in the description but you guys are my beloved jailbirds as you might have seen there was actually a peek at your guys's design as well I will show that more in depth in just a little bit here as well as for my goals I have quite a few I would be really really happy if I could collab with every single person in hollow life you guys might be able to imagine I'm I love Idols hella live to me is the idol company and so I it's my dream to be here and I love everyone I love all my Senpai I love all the Ian Sim file the JP Sunfire all the ID some fight everyone's been so amazing and I I really really really want to be able to collab with every single one of them so that's that's a big fake dream for me big dream um I'd really love to make an original album as well well I'm here obviously I love to sing if it's not apparent already at this point um so it would be a very big wish fulfillment for me nerissa to be able to make an original album I'd also love to voice act Lots you might have seen from my op video that uh I did a little bit of voice acting just dabbled in it a little bit and I think it would be really cool to be able to have the opportunity to do more of that stuff um as well um I'd also really love to sing an opening or ending for an anime I just think that would be so cool like imagine every single day every day or not not every day but once a week okay people are going and sitting on the couch and listening to your voice by force because they're watching their favorite anime and they're listening they're listening to you um that's just amazing to me it's so it's so incredible I just I feel like that be crazy you know so I really uh that's that's a big big dream of mine give me one sec I'm gonna take a sip of water and then we'll continue sorry about that I got really thirsty because I've been I've been so excited this whole time um I'd also really like to make a vocal synthesizer think think think like Hatsune Miku right but like me okay and imagine if a holiday fans could make uh songs with my voice I think that'd be crazy I think that'd be fun yeah like like Vocaloid Utah stuff I think that'd be really cool so you know I don't know if that'll happen but it's something I'd like to do um I'd also really like to reach by 500k subscribers I think that would be really cool um so please help me reach that goal that's up to you my beloved jailbirds um I'd also really like to become fluid in Japanese uh my my Senpai are also amazing and I'd really love to be able to communicate properly with the JP Senpai and not have to make them accommodate me just because I can't speak Japanese you know um so that's that's a big desire as well um and those are my goals down here is what kind of content uh what kind of content you can expect from me and I do want to say uh there's already there there's definitely more but I wanted to keep it pretty pretty simple I suppose um there will be more that's obviously added to this over time but for now the things that you can expect from me are gaming streams that sedans music and voice acting content so I hope you'll all look forward to all of that um and I do have a credit list now I do want to say the actual credits are in the description so if you want to check everyone out I really couldn't have made this debut possible without all of these amazing people here please please please check out the description and give them all a follow I would appreciate that so much first
